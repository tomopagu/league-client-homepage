# League Homepage

A page to replace the Homepage of the League Client.

## Workflow

1. Run `gulp` to initially compile the site. (May have to run twice)
2. Run `gulp watch` to watch files with livereload as you work.
3. Once done with your work, run `gulp build` to build the site with assets minified & compressed. This is placed in a folder called `/dist`. Go here and double-check the site works/looks as intended.
